git branch -a  ----list the branches and the one with * is the one that we're working with
git checkout nameOfThebranch -----changing the branch that we are working with *
git push -u origin nameOfThebranch ----pushing to the remote branch /the -u is for assoisiating the branches so the next usage can be just"git push ,git pull"
---------Merge a branch--------------------
git bracnh --merged --- list the merged branches
git checkout master ---changing * to master
git pull origin master --pulling last updated master
git merge nameOfThebranch ---merging master with branch
git push origin master --- pushing the master to the remote directory
----------delete bracnh---------
git branch -d nameOfThebranch ---deleting the bracnh from the local directory	
git push origin --delete nameOfThebranch --- deleting the bracnh in the remote directory
